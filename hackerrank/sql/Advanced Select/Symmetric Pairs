'''
You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 ≤ Y1.

SELECT DISTINCT LEAST(f1.X, f1.Y) AS X, GREATEST(f1.X, f1.Y) AS Y
FROM Functions f1
JOIN Functions f2 
ON f1.X = f2.Y AND f1.Y = f2.X
ORDER BY X;
